## Problem Description

Georgia Emergency Medical Center needed a database portraying the relationships between many different entities, involving attributes and identifiers. It is extremely important for this database to exist so that proper prescriptions are in place, proper treatment is given, and diagnoses are recorded correctly. The central entity of the database is the Patients entity - this is because patients are the heart of every hospital and are the reason it exists, and conjoins to nearly half of the entities in the diagram. We are interested in accurately portraying this relationship and producing queries that solve important questions that the hospital may have to answer in the future. 

## Data Model

The "Patients" entity serves as a central component of the database. It has a one-to-many relationship with "Medical Records," meaning that each patient can have multiple medical records associated with different visits. Additionally, there's a one-to-one relationship with "Emergency Contacts" to store essential contact information for each patient.

The "Medical Staff" entity represents healthcare professionals working at the clinic. It has a one-to-many relationship with "Appointments," as each staff member can have multiple appointments. Similarly, it has a one-to-many relationship with "Medical Records" since they are responsible for documenting patient interactions and treatments.

"Medical Records" are associated with both patients and medical staff. This many-to-one relationship links each medical record to a specific patient and the attending medical staff member who created it. This relationship ensures that each medical record is attributed to the correct patient and responsible medical professional.

The "Appointments" entity relates to both patients and medical staff, with many-to-one relationships. It ties specific appointments to individual patients and medical staff members, allowing for effective scheduling and tracking of patient visits.

“Emergency Contacts”: Each patient has a one-to-one relationship with their emergency contacts, storing important contact information for emergencies. This relationship ensures that each patient's vital contact information is readily available when needed.

"Suppliers" have a one-to-many relationship with "Inventory" to manage the supply chain. Each supplier can provide multiple items in the inventory, simplifying procurement and tracking.

The "Inventory" entity is connected to suppliers through a many-to-one relationship. It helps in keeping track of available medical supplies and equipment, allowing efficient inventory management.

“Billing records” have a many-to-one relationship with patients, associating each billing record with a specific patient. This relationship helps in tracking the financial aspects of patient care and payments.

“Facilities” have a one-to-many relationship with "Medical Equipment" to keep track of the equipment available in each facility. This relationship assists in organizing and maintaining the clinic's equipment.

“Medical equipment” is associated with facilities through a many-to-one relationship. It ensures that the equipment in each facility is appropriately documented and maintained.

"Prescriptions" have many-to-one relationships with both patients and medical staff. This relationship links each prescription to a specific patient and the prescribing medical professional.

“Emergency transport” records are associated with medical staff in a one-to-many relationship, indicating which medical staff members were involved in specific emergency transport incidents
